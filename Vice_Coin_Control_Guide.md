# Vice Coin Control Guide üçè

Vice is a PoS coin with masternodes. The rewards for a block will be broken down into 90% Masternodes and 10% PoS. If you don't have enough VICE for a masternode or want to stake your Masternode rewards Coin Control will be interesting for you.

You will get 10% of reward per stake. The more VICE you have in your wallet the more often you get a reward.  The stake rewards combine with the generating input. It will create more parcels which you can combine into a big one with Coin Control. This will increase your weight and get you rewards more often. Here is how you do it:

<b>When you're in you wallet you:</b>

    Go to settings > Options > Wallet > Click Enable coin control features
    Go to send tab and click ''Open Coin Control''
    Sellect all the coins you have and then click ''OK''
    Go to file > Receiving addresses > Copy your address 
    Go to the ''Send'' tab and paste your address
    Enter the ''After fee'' amount on the top right corner into the ''Amount'' box where you send the coins.
    Hit send and yours coins are now in one parcel!

You can check this by going to the ''Open Coin Control'' tab again. 

I suggest doing this every stake. Everytime you do coin control your coins will have to mature again but since the maturity time of VICE is only 60 Minutes this is no problem.

I hope this guide helped you! If you have any questions feel free to contact me on discord (Rens#6953) or comment your question here.
